## Sample Python/Django Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at transforming the thesis project management system at Tribhuvan University (TU) by developing a dynamic web application using Django. The new system will replace the current, inefficient mix of email, Excel, and Word documents with a streamlined, interactive platform that enhances collaboration and efficiency for students, supervisors, and the Unit Coordinator.

## Current System

The current thesis project management process involves:

- Emailing and updating spreadsheets for thesis topics.
- Manual email exchanges for topic selection and supervisor approvals.
- Submitting signed supervision agreements via Learnline.

## Pain Points

The current system has several key pain points:

1. **Inefficient Workflow**: Manual processes are repetitive and error-prone.
2. **Supervisor Capacity Blind Spot**: Students often face disappointments due to hidden limitations in supervisor capacity.
3. **Form Errors and Delays**: Frequent errors in standard forms require time-consuming corrections.
4. **Manual Data Management**: Redundant updates and double data entry create unnecessary complexity.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Enhanced Efficiency**: Centralized workflows and automation reduce manual tasks and errors.
2. **Improved Communication**: A shared platform fosters transparent communication among all stakeholders.
3. **Accessibility**: The web-based application can be accessed from anywhere, anytime, on various devices.
4. **Data Integrity**: Secure data storage and access controls protect student and project information.
